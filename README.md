===================

Tetris to run on Raspberry Pi Minecraft using pygame and mcpi

This project uses exactly the same code as [my other Tetris project which runs on the Raspberry Pi with PiLite](https://github.com/shblythe/python2-pilite), except that the function which renders the pygame Surface to the PiLite has been replaced with a function which renders the Surface into the minecraft world.
